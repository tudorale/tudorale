### A little story about me ðŸ’¬
I started in August 2019 to learn Web Development, I started with HTML5 and CSS3 then I was going where the true developing started, JavaScript, I learned JS until I knew that I am feeling good with it and I can start with a framework, at that time all the people in this field said that React JS is easy to learn and the best when we talk about Front-End, and I started learnig it, I fell in love with it and know I'm using it almost all the time, from then until now I am learning new stuff and trying to do my best!.
